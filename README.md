## DockerUI

```
DockerUI is a web interface to interact with the Remote API.  
The goal is to provide a pure client side implementation so it is effortless to connect and manage 
docker.This project is not complete and is still under heavy development.
```

### New Functionality added
```
#* Search repositories from docker hub
#* Pull repositories from docker hub
#* commit container
#* Push files to a docker hub
```


### Quickstart 

#### Step 1

Configure CORS Request :

To enable cross origin requests to the remote api add the flag "â€“api-enable-cors" when running docker in daemon mode.

```
vim /etc/default/docker

Copy paste below line to /etc/default/docker at end

DOCKER_OPTS="-H unix:///var/run/docker.sock -H tcp://0.0.0.0:4243 -api-enable-cors"

Restart the Docker Service 

/etc/default#service docker.io start
```


#### Step 2
  
Pull the latest image:  
  
```
docker pull madhavkobal/dockerui:latest
```
  
#### Step 3
If you're running Docker using a unix socket (default):  
  
```
docker run -d -p 9999:9999 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker.sock \
--name dockerui madhavkobal/dockerui:latest -e="/docker.sock"
```
  
If you're running Docker over tcp:  
  
```
docker run -d -p 9999:9999 --name dockerui \
madhavkobal/dockerui:latest -e="http://<docker_host_ip>:4243"
```
  
#### Step 4
```
Open your browser to `http://localhost:9999`  
Or
Open your browser to `http://<dockerd host ip>:9999`  

If you're running Docker using go server: 

Extract your downloaded zip file dockerui-master.
Run go server using :
 go run dockerui.go
 Open your browser to `http://localhost:9999` 
```  
  
#### Warning
Bind mounting the unix socket into the DockerUI container is much more secure than exposing your docker 
daemon over TCP. You should still secure your DockerUI instance behind some type of auth.  Maybe running 
Nginx infront of DockerUI with basic auth.

### Goals
* Little to no dependencies - I really want to keep this project a pure html/js app.  I know this will have to change so that I can introduce authentication and authorization along with managing multiple docker endpoints. 
* Consistency - The web UI should be consistent with the commands found on the docker CLI.

### Stack
* Angular.js
* Flatstrap ( Flat Twitter Bootstrap )
* Spin.js
* Ace editor
